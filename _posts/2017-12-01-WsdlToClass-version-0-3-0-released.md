With many developers putting renewed energy in their side/pet project I also decided to hop onto the boat to tip the scale in the benefit of PHP 7. Seeing many other open source developers dropping PHP 5.* support I decided to take the same appraoch for WsdlToClass.

Today I released version 0.3.0 for my personal tool which can generate the majority of all classes as found in a WSDL. This has proven a time saver on implementing large web services offered by some customers.

As an added bonus I added support for templates and even a PHP 7 template.
